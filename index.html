        <section><h2>My Favorite Hobby</h2>
        <p>Weight lifting or training is my most favorite hobby. I started weight training in 2019. I joined gym to do cardio but once I got my hands om dumbells I fell in 
            love with the feeling! I used to train six times a week. My journey since I started weight lifting has been magical! I have learned so much about myself. I have become mentally strong and positive. 
            Being a full-time student and part-time job its hard to manage time and workout at the Gym. I try to make time and train atleast three times a week. This is my one of my hobby that can change my mood, thoughts and make me 
            mentally strong.
